## Objects
Start by looking at "dumb" objects (records or dictionaries; mappings from names to values).

### Accessing content of a record
1. Access by field names:
- similar to how Python and similar languages handle it
2. Accessing by "opening" it:
```(with r.expr e)``` -> add the bindings in the record to the current env in which you evaluate e

```
EWith(rExp, e).eval(env) =
r = rExp.eval(env)
return e.eval(r.bindings + env)
```

## Object-Oriented Programming
An object is basically data and functions acting on that data.

Class-based approach: classes that are basically templates for objects.
- you instantiate a class to get an object (an instance of the class)

Prototype-based approach: objects are derived from existing objects.

### Class relationships
1. client side
- subclassing B <: A
- "An instance of B can be used everywhere an instance of A is expected."
- nominal (need to specify if B is subclass, commonly used) vs structural (based on organization and reference)
2. implementation side
- inheritance: a code reuse mechanism
- A <- B
