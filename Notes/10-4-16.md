# Lesson 4

## Functional programming
Characterized by:
- everything is an expression returning a value
- functions are first-class citizens (can be created and passed around)

Purest form:
- evaluations has no side-effects
- evaluation is lazy

### Higher-order functions
Function that takes a function as an argument. Matches with the substitution model. Can be used to capture the structure of a family of functions.

### Anonymoose functions
Lambda used to define new functions that define a variable and return some transformation on that variable.

### Binding strategies
Dynamic binding:
- look for the value in the nearest enclosing bindings where the function is called

Static binding:
- look for the value in the nearest enclosing bindings where the function is defined
- most languages use static binding
