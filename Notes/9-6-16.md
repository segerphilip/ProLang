# Lesson 1

DSL - domain-specific language

## Programming languages:
- designing
- implementing

### Paradigm - what does a program "mean"
- Imperative languages - a program is a sequence of instrutions for the computer to do something
*e.x. assembly - C - Python, Javascript*
- Functional languages - a "mathematical" expression that reduces to a result
*e.x. lisp - scheme - haskell, ML*
- Object-oriented languages - a program is a collection of objects communicating with each other via messages
*e.x. simula, smalltalk - C++ - Java*
- Logic-based languages - a program in a search through a shared space
*e.x. prolog, datalog*
- Probabalistic languages

### Examples of lower level tradeoffs:
- Data uniformity: 
    - e.g. is every value an object = ease of programming **vs.** ease of implementation
- Memory alocation:
    - manually vs. automatic
    - manually good for games, but more often use automatic
- OO dispatch:
    - class A with method x and class B with method x, calling class A.x(), underlying calls B
    - virtual methods ~ what makes OO tick, but **slow...**

# Homework
- add boolean operators EAnd, EOr, ENot, EIsZero (expressions)
- add vectors of values (e.x. <e1, e2, e3, e4> which evaluates to a vector with evaluated values in place of expressions)
- add rational numbers and division, ERational (numerator and denominator) and EDiv (exp1 and exp2, evaluate to ERational)
- **Extra** make EAnd and EOr short-circuit (e.x. false AND == done, true OR == done evaluating from left to right, can stop evaluating and return)
