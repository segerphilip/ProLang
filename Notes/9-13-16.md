## Abstraction of Expressions
In other words, __helper functions!__ For example:
~~~
class EExpression(Exp):
    def __init__(self, e1, e2):
        self._exp1 = e1
        self._exp2 = e2

    def eval(self):
        v1 = self._exp1.eval()
        v2 = self._exp2.eval()
        return expOnVals(v1, v2)
~~~
Using expOnVals() simplifies our code quite a bit, plus can be called other places if needed. Along with this, building a primitive dictionary can help us along the way:
~~~
INITIAL_PRIM_DICT = {
    "+" : oper_plus,
    "-" : oper_minus,
    "*" : oper_times
}
~~~
and then called using `e = EPrimCall("+", [EInteger(1), EInteger(2)]), e.eval(INITIAL_PRIM_DICT).value`

## Local Bindings
Introduces a way to give a local name to an expression, e.g.
~~~
let (x = 10 + 10)
  x * x
~~~
which should evaluate to `400`. To accomplish this, we need to save this as a new node with an id to call it (`x`), the first expression for that id (`x = 10 + 10`), and the expression to perform with those values (`x * x`).

### The Substitution Model
Replace every occurrence of one id with the value it is assigned. However, setting the same id multiple times with different values makes things tricky. The rule: closes let to the variable assignment results in the assignment, e.g.
~~~
let (x = 10)
  let (y = x)
    let (x = 30)
      x * y
~~~
which results in `300`.

But... we don't have substitution yet, so we would need to define it (*check slides for explanation*).
