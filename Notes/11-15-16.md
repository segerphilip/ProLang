## Dynamic checks
Interpretation -> compiler -> primitive operations

These do dynamic type checks: + safety, - inefficiency (~20%)

C/C++: efficiency over safety

Java: safety over efficiency (that's why Java is sometimes thought as "slower")

2 approaches:

1. Do an analysis to see what dynamic checks are required and which can be dropped. (static analysis)
2. Move the checks up to the user as a static type system. (add types to program and decide before executing the code)

### Before evaluating, we do type checking:

- associate with every expression node in the abstract representation of our code a type and make sure all the types "agree"
- add a method called typecheck(symtable) to every abstract representation
    - symtable associates a type to every identifier and the method then returns the type of the expression or an exception if type checking fails

#### e.x.
EValue(VInteger(i)).typecheck(st) = TInteger()

EValue(VBoolean(b)).typecheck(st) = TBoolean()

EId(n).typecheck(st) = st(n)

EIf(c,t,e).typecheck(st) = check condition, t, and expression, if type of t and e doesn't match, fail

EFunction(params,tparams,body).typecheck(st) = check body with st and zip(params, tparams)

ECall(f,args).typecheck(st) = find type of f, check that is function, check length of Tparams and params, if any from TParams fails type check agains args fail, otherwise return type of body
