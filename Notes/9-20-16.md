# Lesson 3
## Surface Syntax

Abstract representations: good for computers
Surface syntax: good for ~~humans~~ programmers

### Front-end
Surface syntax:
~~~
let (x = 10 + 20)
    x * x
~~~
Abstract representation:
~~~
ELet ("x", EPlus ( EInteger(10), (EInteger(20)),
ETimes (EId("x"),
        EId("x"))))
~~~

Two steps:
- sequence of characters go through tokenization
- tokens go through parsing to result in an abstract representation

### Tokens
Unit of meaning, sentences use words and programs use tokens. Tokens can include: integers, floating point nums, identifiers, operation symbols + - *..., punctuation () , ...

Characters -> tokens :local decision

### Lexer
Takes an input of tokens and outputs a sequence of tokens, or breaks nicely


### S-expressions
Example: (let ((x (+ 10 20))) (* x x))
Basically prefix notation

### Parser combinators
Create a small parser (for example pyparsing), then build it up by making new parsers that include the smaller/easier ones.
